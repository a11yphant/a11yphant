  title: Links must have discernible text
  shortDescription: >
    Link text and alternate text for images, when used as links, must be discernible by a screen reader, must not have a duplicate label and must be focusable.
  additionalDescription: >
    Common unhelpful link texts are 'click here', 'read more' and 'link'. These are problematic because when a person using a screen reader is navigating using links alone these will be read out of context.

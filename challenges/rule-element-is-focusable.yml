  additionalDescription: >
    Keyboard accessibility is one of the most important aspects of web accessibility as many users rely on a keyboard and a lot of assistive technologies mimic its functionality. Typically the 'Tab'-key is used to navigate through interactive elements on a website, like links, buttons, input fields, etc. 
    When an element is focused, a visual indicator like an outline must be present. Focus indicators are provided automatically by web browsers. As their appearance varies it is recommended to create a custom focus styling with CSS.

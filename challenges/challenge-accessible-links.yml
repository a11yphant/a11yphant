        Your friend Charles has reached out for your help again. He wants to link to additional resources in his blog post, but he is not sure how to structure the additional resources section. Can you write the markup for him (you don't have to style it for now)?
        Charles wants to add links to the following pages:
          - Introduction to web APIs https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Client-side_web_APIs/Introduction
          - Vibrationssss https://www.amorelie.at/sexspielzeug/vibratoren/mit-fernbedienung/

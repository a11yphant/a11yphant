We decided to continue a11yphant as Open Source project. Our goal is to make the web a more accessible and inclusive place. We do not want to make profit. All money we might receive through sponsorships goes directly into developing a11yphant further.

## Read the Documentation

Everything you need to know to setup the project locally can be found in our [documentation](DOCUMENTATION.md). Please follow our [coding conventions](DOCUMENTATION.md/#coding-conventions).

## Reporting Bugs and Issues

If you think you've found a bug or accessibility issue, feel free to open an issue here on GitHub. Before opening a new issue, please answer this checklist for yourself:

1. I ensured that the problem is not caused by my local environment (e.g., a browser plugin, a really old browser version or unusual browser settings)
2. I checked that no GitHub issue was already filed for this bug

If you answered everything with yes, go ahead and [create a new GitHub issue](https://github.com/a11yphant/a11yphant/issues/new/choose). Be sure to include as much information as possible so we can reproduce the bug.

## Feature Requests

Feature requests are very welcome. But take a moment to find out whether your idea fits with the scope and aims of the project. It's up to you to make a strong case to convince us of this feature. Please provide as much detail and context as possible when opening an issue here on GitHub.

## Writing Content

If you have any ideas for new challenges feel free to [write us an email](mailto:info@a11yphant.com).

> Please contact us first, as we might already work on your topic idea in the background.

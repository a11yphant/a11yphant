## General Information

Technically, a11yphant is split into three applications:

1. The **API** (Backend)
2. The **Site** (Frontend)
3. The **Submission Checker** (Backend)

All three applications are written in [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org). 
The **Site** uses the React framework [NextJS](https://nextjs.org), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).
The **API** and the **Submission Checker** use the Node framework [NestJS](https://nestjs.com). The **API** also uses [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io) and GraphQL. In addition, [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) is used.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Docker

This project uses [Docker](https://www.docker.com/). Please make sure you have it installed.

### 2. Create a GitHub Access Token

Create an access token for the Github API. This access token is required to install our private NPM packages. You can follow [this guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token).

### 3. Install Node via `nvm`

This is important. You must have Node installed via `nvm` for this project to work correctly ([Setup Instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)).

**TLDR:**

1. Log into your GitHub account.
2. Go to *Settings* -> *Developer settings* -> *Personal access tokens* -> *Tokens (classic)*.
3. Create a token and choose the scope `read:packages`.
4. In your terminal, run the following command and login with your github user and the just created token as password:
```bash
npm login --scope=@a11yphant --auth-type=legacy --registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

## Setup

To setup the project the project follow these steps.

1. Clone the repository.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/a11yphant.git
```

2. Make sure all steps from the [prerequisites](#prerequisites) are completed.

3. Make sure, Docker is running.

4. Run the install script.
```bash
# Installs the correct node version, all packages and creates symlinks
./install.sh
```

> **Recommendation:** It is recommended to add one of the following scripts to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`. This script automatically changes to the correct Node version when entering this project. These scripts originate directly from the `nvm` documentation: (1) [bash](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#bash) or (2) [zsh](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#zsh).

5. Start the application.
```bash
# Start all services in the background with pm2:
npm start
```

6. Make a database data import to get dummy data.
```bash
# To load dummy data for challenges into the empty database, run the following command:
npm run import-challenges
```

7. Your application is now up and running at [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001).

8. To stop the application or look into the logs of an individual service, have a look at the sections [Custom NPM Commands](#custom-npm-commands) and [Useful pm2 Commands](#useful-pm2-commands).

## Custom NPM Commands

### Start All Services

You can choose if you want to start the services in the background or in the foreground. If you start them in the background, they are running but you can still use the shell/terminal in the meantime. If you start them in the foreground, you have to press `control + c` to exit/stop the service and use the shell/terminal again.

#### Background

```bash
#Starts all services in the background with `pm2`
npm start

# or

npm run dev
```

#### Foreground

```bash
# Starts all services in the foreground
npm run dev:no-daemon
```

#### Start an individual service

```bash
# API
npm run dotenv -- npm run dev:api

# Site
npm run dotenv -- npm run dev:site
```
> **Note:** The `npm run dotenv` part injects all env vars to the CLI context. Thereby it is possible to wait for other services before starting a service (e.g. `site` only starts when `api` has been started successfully because it depends on a working API).

### Logs
To look into the logs of an individual service you can use the following commands:

```bash
# API
npm run debug:api

# Site
npm run debug:site
```

### Stop All Services

```bash
npm run stop
```

## Coding conventions

We follow some coding conventions within this project. We try to use a uniform system for our commits and branch names. With this system we hope to achieve better readable, easy to follow and easy to understand messages when looking through the project history.


### HTML

Please always keep in mind to write accessible semantic HTML within your React components.

#### Class Order

When assigning Tailwind classes to an HTML element, they have to be in a specific order. In addition, they are wrapped and separated inside `clsx{("")}`, which is an npm package we use to have a more visually pleasing structure. 

```JSX
// an example:
<a
 className={clsx("my-8 font-sans", "hover:text-primary-light","focus-rounded-instead-of-underline", "md:my-0")}
>
    info@a11yphant.com
</a>
```

The order of classes within `clsx` is as follows:

1. classes that don't fit into any other bullet point category (like positioning, colors, fonts, etc.)
2. animation stuff like `group`, `transition`, etc.
3. `Hover` styles
4. `Focus` styles
5. custom Tailwind classes
6. Breakpoint `xs`
7. Breakpoint `sm`
8. Breakpoint `md`
9. Breakpoint `lg`
10. Breakpoint `xl`
11. Breakpoint `2xl`


Please keep in mind to only use classes you really need. If you refactor a component, remember to check the responsibility and adapt the style changes in the breakpoints accordingly.

### CSS

We use Tailwind for styling. If you want to set global variables you can do so in the `tailwind.config.js` file. Some very specific custom stylings can be found in the folder *Styles* within the **Site** application. This folder contains: 
- a SCSS file that imports all fonts: `fonts.scss`
- a SCSS file for custom stylings (like media queries or custom focus styles): `custom.scss`
- a SCSS file that sets some global styles (for headings, text-length, etc.): `global.scss`

### Testing

We write tests in the frontend and the backend to assure code quality. We primarily have the following tests across our three applications:
- **API**
    - Unit Tests
    - Integration Tests (with the DB and business logic)
    - Service Tests (for important GraphQL queries)
- **Site**
    - Unit Tests
- **Submission Checker**
    - Unit Tests
    - Service Tests
- **Global**
    - End-to-End Tests that test the core functionality of a11yphant

> **Note:** To get a feature merged, it is mandatory to write a meaningful test. 

To see if your written test passes or fails, you can go to the folder of the specific service you are working in (**API**, **Site**, **Submission Checker**) and run the following command:
```bash
npm run test:watch
```

### Commit Messages

We try to commit changes in logical chunks. Our commit messages are formatted as follows:

```bash
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

**Please note that:**

- The HEADER is a single line of max. 50 characters that contains a succinct description of the change. It
contains 
    1. a type
    2. an optional scope
    3. and a subject
- `<type>` describes the kind of change that this commit is providing. Allowed types are:
    - `feat`: new feature for the user, not a new feature for build script
    - `fix`: bug fix for the user, not a fix to a build script
    - `docs`: changes to the documentation
    - `style`: formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no production code change
    - `refactor`: refactoring production code, eg. renaming a variable
    - `test`: adding missing tests, refactoring tests; no production code change
    - `chore`: updating grunt tasks etc; no production code change
- `<scope>` can be anything specifying the place of the commit change
- `<subject>` is a very short description of the change, in the following format:
    - imperative, present tense: “change” not “changed”/“changes"
    - no capitalized first letter
    - no dot (.) at the end
- The BODY should include the motivation
for the change and contrast this with previous behavior and must be
phrased in imperative present tense
- The FOOTER should contain any information about Breaking Changes and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit closes

More information on [Git Commit Msg](https://karma-runner.github.io/4.0/dev/git-commit-msg.html).

### Branches

We never work on the `development`branch directly. All changes are made in a separate branch that will be merged into the development branch after a successful code review. Our branch names are formatted as follows:

```bash
<type>/<short-description-of-task>
```

- `<type>` describes the kind of change this branch is providing. Allowed types are:
    - **feature**
    - **bugfix**
    - **renovate**

- `<short-description-of-task>` should give a very short description what this branch does.


## Useful pm2 Commands

> **Note:** You have to install `pm2` globally using `npm i -g pm2` before these commands will work.

### Show all running services
```bash
pm2 list
```

### Synchronize running services
```bash
# This is useful as sometimes the list is out of sync
pm2 save

# if this does not help
pm2 save --force
```

### Show logs
```bash
# same as: npm run debug:<service-name>
pm2 logs <pm2-service-name>
```

### Stop all services
```bash
# same as: npm run stop
pm2 stop all
```

### Stop individual service
```bash
pm2 stop <pm2-service-name>
```

### Delete all services
```bash
pm2 del all
```

### Delete individual service
```bash
pm2 del <pm2-service-name>
```

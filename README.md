## About a11yphant

<p>
  <span aria-label="Allyphant">a11yphant</span> <span aria-hidden="true">(pronounced [ˈɛlifənt])</span> teaches developers the basics of web accessibility. Learn step by step by completing short, interactive coding challenges and quizzes.
</p>

In an ideal world, all websites are designed and developed so everyone can use them. Sadly, many websites do not comply with web accessibility guidelines. Therefore, especially people with impairments and disabilities are barred from using them. One of the main problems is that many developers don't know enough about web accessibility. a11yphant wants to improve this situation by giving them a tool for learning accessibility in a fun, interactive way.

<p>
  <span aria-label="Allyphant">a11yphant</span> is an interactive online course for web accessibility. In this course, you will revisit web
  development topics from an accessibility perspective. For example, how to make sure that assistive technologies like screen readers can
  interact with the website? Or, what is the purpose of the different semantic HTML elements? These are some of the things you will learn by
  writing meaningful markup and completing quizzes.
